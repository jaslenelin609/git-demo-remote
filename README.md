# git-demo-remote
this is the project for learning how to initiate a Git project remotely

Firstly, you will create a Git repository remotely hosted in the Github and then, from the local terminal, you can directly download it.

Then, you are able to work on it locally to modify the file. The next step is to implement git add to add the modified file to the staging area, which is in between the local working directory and the local Git repository. Then use git status to view files in the staging area. Use git commit with comments to commit the changes to the local Git repository. Finally, if you want to commit it to the remote Github, you need to use git push origin main (which is the name of your default branch in Github).
